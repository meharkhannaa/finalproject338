    <p><b>Problem Statement:</b>Culturally Situated Design Tools (CSDT) wants to make sure to address accessibility concerns to make sure that their website is accessible to all varying abilities and identities.</p>
    <p><b>Process Outline:</b>We began with automated testing, then transitioned to manual testing. We performed a WCAG 3.1 Accessibility Audit
        and delivered our findings and recommendations for improvement in a presentation and subsequent report to the website's organization lead.</p>
    <p><b>Testing and Debugging:</b>We performed both automated and manual testing for each page of the website.</p>
    <p><b>Challenges:</b>The website was very image heavy and no images had alternative text. To address this, we created a how-to guide on alt text captions and provided 45+ examples with real images from the website.</p>
    <p><b>Outcome & Reflection: </b></p>
    <p><b>Final Product: </b></p>
